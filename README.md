# API
```
The unofficial and small Studio Ghibli api.
```

It's `small` cause I don't plan it to have all Studio Ghibli details like world, vehicles, etc... Just the movies.

## Motivation
I'm studying the Rust programming language, and now I'm confident that I can build something simple, but reliable to commmunity and also, blaaazingly fast.

## TODO
- [ ] Add more movies
- [ ] Route for characters (maybe?)
